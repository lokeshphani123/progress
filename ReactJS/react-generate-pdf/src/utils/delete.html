      <h2>Components</h2>
      <p>Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI that can be composed together to build complex interfaces.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Props</h2>
      <p>Props are short for properties and are used to pass data from parent to child components in React. They are immutable and help in making components more dynamic and reusable.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>State</h2>
      <p>State is used to manage the data that changes over time in a React component. It allows components to be dynamic and interactive by updating their UI in response to user actions or other events.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Lifecycle Methods</h2>
      <p>Lifecycle methods are special methods that are invoked at specific points in a component's lifecycle. They allow you to perform actions such as setting up the component, updating the component, and cleaning up resources when the component is removed from the DOM.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Hooks</h2>
      <p>Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They let you use state and other React features in functional components.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's useful for sharing common data such as themes, user authentication, or language preferences.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Forms</h2>
      <p>Forms in React work differently from traditional HTML forms. They allow you to create controlled components where form data is handled by React rather than the DOM, enabling more interactive and dynamic forms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Refs</h2>
      <p>Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. They are useful for managing focus, text selection, or triggering imperative animations.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Error Boundaries</h2>
      <p>Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire component tree.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Higher-Order Components (HOC)</h2>
      <p>Higher-Order Components are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced functionality. They are used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and composition in React applications.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Render Props</h2>
      <p>Render Props is a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. This allows components to share rendering logic without being tightly coupled to each other.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Portals</h2>
      <p>Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. They are useful for implementing features like modals, tooltips, and popovers.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Lazy Loading</h2>
      <p>Lazy loading is a technique for optimizing React applications by deferring the loading of components until they are actually needed. This can improve initial load times and reduce the amount of code that needs to be loaded upfront.</p>
